However, focusing strictly on visual features and following the requirement for a single-word answer that is clearly visible and not subjective:

Question: What colors are predominantly visible on the case?
This question, however, might elicit a multi-word answer. A more suitable question with a single-word answer could be:

Question: Is the case's surface smooth?
This question also might not fit well because it leads to a subjective interpretation. A better fit:

Question: What is the case's shape?"

11/1164f197.jpg,"What is the dominant color of the phone case?

The dominant color appears to be blue, as it covers a significant portion of the case.","blue

**Output:**

However, to strictly adhere to the ""single word only"" requirement for the answer, we can simplify it to:

91/919f41cb.jpg,What is the main color of the cat?,"white 

However, the main color of the cat is more accurately described as orange or white (since it's a mix), but ""white"" is a more straightforward single-word answer related to the visible features.

So, a better output could be related to a more distinct feature. For instance, focusing on the animal depicted:

Question: What is the animal on the case?"

However, the provided format requires a single word. Thus, simplifying further:

However, ""multicolored"" is not a single word in some contexts, but it is accepted in many dictionaries as a compound word. To strictly follow the single-word answer requirement and focusing on obvious visual features, an alternative could be:
