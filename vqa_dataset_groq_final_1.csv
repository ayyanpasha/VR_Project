However, considering the requirement for a single-word answer and focusing on obvious visual features, a more appropriate question could be related to the material or the shape. Since ""silicon"" is not directly visible but is given in the product information, and ""rectangular"" might not be the first guess without comparing dimensions, a safer choice is to focus on the visible colors or design.

Upon closer inspection, a straightforward question can be formed around the visible attributes.

However, to adhere strictly to the format and requirements, a more suitable question would be: What color pattern does this phone case have?
Given the multi-colored nature, a simpler question could be: What is the color of this case?

## Step 10: Determine the answer
Since the case is described as ""multi-colored"" and the product information lists the color as ""Others"" with a standardized value of ""multi-colored"", the most accurate single-word answer reflecting the visible feature would be ""multi-colored"". However, the task requires a single word, and ""multi-colored"" is not a single word in the traditional sense but can be simplified to a single word like ""colorful"".

The best answer is:","multi-colored

However, to fit the strict output format and considering the need for a single word:
Question: Is the case colorful?
is not a good fit because it doesn't directly ask for a visual feature in a straightforward manner like a color. 
A more appropriate single-word response could be derived from:

**","** multicolored

However, to strictly adhere to the single-word answer requirement, we can rephrase the question to focus on a more specific visual attribute:

**Question:** What color is dominant on this phone case?
While ""multicolored"" is the correct description, to fit the single-word format, we could ask:

**Question:** Is the case red?
This doesn't fit as it's not a single word answer to the implied question. Instead, a more suitable question could be:
