However, upon closer inspection, while orange is a prominent color, the overall design is multi-colored, and ""multi-colored"" isn't a single color. A more accurate single-word answer focusing on the obvious visual feature (the multi-colored nature) isn't directly possible because the required answer format demands a single color or a very specific attribute.

Let's adjust our approach to fit the required format and focus on the fact that the case is indeed multi-colored, and ""colored"" could be a suitable single-word answer if we frame the question correctly.

While the case is multi-colored, the presence of several colors makes ""color"" a bit ambiguous. However, one of the most visible colors is ""red"" or ""yellow."" Since ""multicolor"" is a characteristic but not a color per se, and the task requires a single word, we could consider the most prominent single color visible.

Alternatively, focusing on the material:
The product information states it's made of plastic, but we can still form a question related to visual features.

Let's form a question based on the visible attributes:","multicolor

However, the task requires a single word that is clearly visible and related to the visual feature. Since ""multicolor"" is a characteristic and not a simple color, we should look for another attribute.

Let's simplify:
The case is clearly ""colorful,"" and ""multi-colored"" is the given color attribute. A single word that could describe the visual feature could be related to its appearance.

Thus, a potential output could be:
Question: What is the case?"
39/3923dc47.jpg,What is the dominant animal on this phone case?,lion
60/60c5cc4a.jpg,"** What color is the lion?
**",** brown
54/54fe8e10.jpg,"What color is dominant in this accessory?
Given the mix of colors, a reasonable single-word answer focusing on one of the prominent colors could be ""orange,"" as it's one of the dominant colors visible.","orange

Thus, the output in the required format is:

   - The question must be answerable from the image.
   - It should have a single-word answer.
   - It must focus on obvious visual features.

Given these requirements, a suitable question could be related to the color or the material of the phone case, or its notable features.

3. **Formulating the Question and","**
   - Considering the visible features, a question about the dominant color of the phone case is appropriate. The dominant color is ""black.""
   - Another possible question could be about the material, but since the material is not directly visible, it's better to stick with what we can see.

Therefore, a suitable question and answer based on the image could be:
Question: What is the main color of the phone case?"
0d/0dcb0717.jpg,What color are the labels?,white
0e/0ece694f.jpg,What color is the bowl?,white

To generate a question that meets the requirements:

*   It must be clearly answerable from the image.
*   It must have a single-word answer.
*   It must focus on obvious visual features.

Given these constraints, a suitable question could be about the dominant visual feature or attribute of the product.
